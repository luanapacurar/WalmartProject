# WalmartProject
The primary goal of a project focused on comparing neural networks with traditional forecasting methods is to assess and understand how these different approaches perform in predicting future sales based on historical data. By evaluating forecasting accuracy, we aim to identify which method—neural networks like LSTM or traditional methods like ARIMA—provides more reliable predictions for various patterns seen in real-world sales data, such as trends and seasonal fluctuations. This analysis will also highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, helping to determine when one method might be more suitable over the other.

Another important objective is to explore how well neural networks and traditional methods generalize to new data and different business scenarios. By optimizing model settings and parameters, we aim to enhance the accuracy and usability of these forecasting techniques. Additionally, we'll compare the computational efficiency of both approaches, considering factors like training time and resource requirements, to assess their practical feasibility in business settings.

The project aims to provide actionable insights for decision-makers, showing how accurate sales forecasts can inform strategic planning, inventory management, and resource allocation within organizations. By communicating our findings effectively through reports and presentations, we seek to contribute valuable knowledge to the field of time series forecasting, guiding future research and industry practices. Ultimately, the project seeks to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications, delivering tangible benefits to businesses relying on sales predictions for operational success.
